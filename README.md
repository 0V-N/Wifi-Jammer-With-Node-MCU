# WiFi Deauthentication Attack with ESP8266

## Overview

This repository provides a detailed explanation and implementation of a WiFi deauthentication attack using the ESP8266 microcontroller. The deauthentication attack is a network security technique that aims to disconnect devices from a wireless network by sending deauthentication packets.

The project includes the necessary code and instructions to set up the ESP8266 as a deauthentication device and execute the attack on vulnerable networks. It is important to note that this project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for any illegal or malicious activities.

## Requirements

To replicate this project, you will need the following components:

- ESP8266 microcontroller (such as NodeMCU or Wemos D1 Mini)
- USB cable for programming and power supply
- Arduino IDE (or any other compatible IDE)
- WiFi library for Arduino
- Access to a WiFi network for testing

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub: [link to repository]

2. Install the Arduino IDE from the official website: [https://www.arduino.cc/en/software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

3. Connect the ESP8266 to your computer using the USB cable.

4. Open the Arduino IDE and install the ESP8266 board package. Go to **File > Preferences** and enter the following URL in the **Additional Boards Manager URLs** field: `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`. Then, navigate to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for "esp8266," and click **Install**.

5. Select the appropriate board model from the **Tools > Board** menu (e.g., NodeMCU 1.0).

6. Install the WiFi library for Arduino. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**, search for "WiFi," and click **Install**.

7. Open the main project file (e.g., `deauth_attack.ino`) in the Arduino IDE.

8. Configure the attack parameters, such as the target MAC address and the WiFi network SSID, by modifying the values in the code. Make sure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when conducting any testing.

9. Connect to your WiFi network by providing the SSID and password in the code.

10. Upload the code to the ESP8266 by clicking the **Upload** button in the Arduino IDE.

11. Monitor the serial output for any relevant information or error messages.

12. The ESP8266 will begin executing the deauthentication attack on the specified network. Observe the network behavior to see the effect of the attack.

## Usage and Legal Considerations

- The deauthentication attack is an intrusive technique and may violate the terms of service of the targeted network. Ensure you have proper authorization or conduct the attack in a controlled environment.

- This project is intended for educational and informational purposes only. The code provided is meant to facilitate learning and understanding of network security techniques.
